	<h1>Ie-kei Ramen</h1>
	<img src="../img/ie-kei-ramen.jpg" height="500" alt="delicious ramen" />

	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Ie-kei is a ramen specialty from Yokohama. It consists of thick, straight noodles served in a soy flavored pork broth similar to tonkotsu (sometimes referred to as tonkotsu-shoyu). The standard toppings are roasted pork (chāshū), boiled spinach, sheets of nori, often with shredded Welsh onion (negi) and a soft- or hard-boiled egg. <span class="source"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen#Regional_variations">Wikipedia</a></span></p>

	<p>Diners are encouraged to choose the amount of fat, the amount of tare, the richness of the broth and how they want their noodles cooked. There are also a wide array of free toppings available on the counter at iekei shops for customers to further adjust their bowls with, such as minced garlic and ginger, spices, oils, and vinegars.</p>

	<p>A simple bowl of Japanese rice is a perfect accompaniment for a hungry diner, with many adding it directly to the leftover soup as a means of soaking up those final sips of soup, or eating with your soggy nori!<span class="source"><a href="https://matsudai.co.uk/pages/iekei-ramen-recipe">James Chant</a></span></p>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt><h3>Tonkotsu Broth</h3></dt>
		<dd>
			<ol>
				<li>Put the bones and trotters in a large pot and cover with water. Put a lid on and put in the fridge overnight.</li>
				<li>Next day, dump out the water and cover the bones with fresh water. Put pot on the stove on high heat. Gray scum will occasionally rise to the surface, scoop it out. Stir the bones every so often so they don't stick to the bottom. Keep adding water as it evaporates to keep the bones completely covered.</li>
				<li>Keep boiling for a minimum of 8 hours. An hour before taking the broth off the heat, stop adding additional water. Also, add optional ingredients like leeks or garlic now, if desired.</li>
			</ol>
