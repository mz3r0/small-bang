# The Odin Project > Foundations - Proj #1. Recipes

For the Recipes assignment I sourced some recipes from the internet and approached HTML structure of the recipe instructions in two ways, using an unordered list `<ul>` when the steps are simple and a `<dl>` for more organized, detailed steps.

Other details like back-to-top links, spans for formatting later in CSS and alt attributes on images don't need more than mentioning.
